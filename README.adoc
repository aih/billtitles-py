# Bill Title API

## Overview

This repository provides an `http` service to get bills, titles, bills related by title, and bills related by section similarity. It is built on the self-documenting FastAPI in Python and uses data from xref:see-also[other related repositories]. Initially, this data was stored in a `sqlite` database, but was migrated to a `postgres` database. The original version of the API, with SQLite data embedded, is available in self-contained docker containers, through 0.1.5 (`docker run -d -t -i -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/aih/billtitles:0.1.5`)

## Usage

Run using Docker and docker-compose (xref:docker[see below])

Or:

* Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/aih/billtitles-py.git`
* Install Python > 3.7 (preferably with pyenv)
* Install dependencies, including FastAPI and the uvicorn server (pip install -r requirements.txt)
* Run the PostgreSQL database server (using docker: `docker run -d -t -i -p 5432:5432 postgres`)
* Run the server with `uvicorn billtitles.main:app --reload` (default port `8000`)

This will provide an API to query for bills and titles; query similar bills by bill number; (soon) to query similar bills by title; and to create, update, and delete bills and titles.

NOTE: The bill-to-bill data is only up to date through the date of this README.

## API

The API is self-documenting, thanks to FastAPI. It can be viewed and tested at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

The api includes paths to get bills, titles, and bills related by title.

## Docker

Within this repository is a  `docker-compose.yml` file that can be used to run the API in a docker container. The `docker-compose.yml` refers to two docker images:

 - docker.io/arihersh/billtitles (the FastAPI application, contained in this repository and defined by the Dockerfile at the top level of the directory)
 - docker.io/arihersh/billsim-pgsql (the PostgreSQL database. The tables for this are defined in models.py. It is loaded with ~ 2Gb of data derived from processes in the `github.com/aih/billsim` repository. The docker container is built with the dockerfile at dockerpgsa/Dockerfile in this repository.) 

The database container alone can be run with:
`docker container run -d --rm -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres --name billsim-data docker.io/arihersh/billsim-pgsql:latest`

Then the database can be accessed at `psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432`

NOTE: The data in the Docker image is not complete, especially for related bills. The title data should be up-to-date as of the commit of this README. However, it is not meant to be used in production as-is. 

NOTE: For **MacOs users**, it may be necessary to set port forwarding in Virtualbox on MacOs to forward to a host port. Set Guest port to 8000 and host port to whatever you want to use on your local machine (I also use 8000). To set the port forwarding, follow the instructions here: https://www.jhipster.tech/tips/020_tip_using_docker_containers_as_localhost_on_mac_and_windows.html

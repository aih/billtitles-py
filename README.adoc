# Bill Title API

## Overview

This repository provides an `http` service to get bills, titles, bills related by title, and bills related by section similarity. It is built on the self-documenting FastAPI in Python and uses data from xref:see-also[other related repositories].

## Usage

Install using Docker (xref:docker[see below])

Or:

* Install `git-lfs` to download the sqlite3 database that goes with this API. (https://git-lfs.github.com/).
* Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/aih/billtitles-py.git`
* Install Python > 3.7 (preferably with pyenv)
* Install dependencies, including FastAPI and the uvicorn server (pip install -r requirements.txt)
* Use Git lfs to download the billtitles.db file (~ 120MB) into the top level directory of the repository
* Run the server with `uvicorn billtitles.main:app --reload` (default port `8000`)

This will provide an API to query for bills and titles; query similar bills by bill number; (soon) to query similar bills by title; and to create, update, and delete bills and titles.

NOTE: The bill-to-bill data is only up to date through the date of this README. Some sample bills are shown below.

## API

The API is self-documenting, thanks to FastAPI. It can be viewed and tested at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

The api includes paths to get bills, titles, and bills related by title:

`/bills/related/{billnumber}`

## Docker

A docker image is provided at `arihersh/billtitles` on Dockerhub. To run it, install Docker, and run:

`docker run -d -t -i -p 8000:8000 arihersh/billtitles`

This will expose the API on your local port `8000`. To expose another local port (e.g., `2222`), instead run `docker run -d -t -i -p 2222:8000 arihersh/billtitles`.

This will install and run the container (about 1Gb) as a daemon.

NOTE: The data in the Docker image is not complete, especially for related bills. The title data should be up-to-date as of the commit of this README. However, it is not meant to be used in production as-is. 

NOTE: For **MacOs users**, it may be necessary to set port forwarding in Virtualbox on MacOs to forward to a host port. Set Guest port to 8000 and host port to whatever you want to use on your local machine (I also use 8000). To set the port forwarding, follow the instructions here: https://www.jhipster.tech/tips/020_tip_using_docker_containers_as_localhost_on_mac_and_windows.html

See also the `github.com/aih/bills` and `github.com/aih/billtitles` repositories in Go.

The `github.com/aih/bills` repository provides a Go module to process bills that were downloaded using the unitedstates/congress scrapers. The `github.com/aih/billtitles` repository is another Go module that converts the json output from `bills` into sqlite3. It also provides a (crude) Go API to query for bills and titles.
